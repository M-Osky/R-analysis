# R ANALYSIS
Some short R scripts I wrote to analyse my data.
This is just a sample of some of the bioestatistics work I do with R either for our own research or for the students.

- The scripts done to be run in desktop R have some lines on the top describing the analysis, options and input file
- The scripts done to be run from command line (unix) have their own help information with the flag --help

# Short description

- HWtest
  Analysis per population of loci out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, filter out according to a p-value and percentage.
- LDA
  Incomplete LDA analysis script, it works but needs to be adjusted and annotated properly for each case, still could be useful for some people starting
- ANOVA
  Useful script when doing exploratory analysis of multiple files, we use it to check if the same variables behave similarly in different datasets

# Will be adding here more descriptions
